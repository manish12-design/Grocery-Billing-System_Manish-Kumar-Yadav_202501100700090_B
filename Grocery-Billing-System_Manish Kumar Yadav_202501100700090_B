# Grocery Store Billing System
# This program calculates total bill amount,
# applies discount if applicable, and shows final payable amount.

# initialize total amount
total = 0

# Loop to take input for 5 items
for i in range(1, 6):
    print("\nItem", i)
    
    # Taking price and quantity input
    price = float(input("Enter price of item: "))
    quantity = int(input("Enter number of units: "))
    
    # Add cost of current item to total
    total += price * quantity

# Display original total
print("\nOriginal Total Amount = Rs.", total)

# Apply discount if total exceeds Rs.100
if total > 100:
    discount = total * 0.10   # 10% discount
else:
    discount = 0

# Final payable amount
final_amount = total - discount

# Display discount and final amount
print("Discount = Rs.", discount)
print("Final Payable Amount = Rs.", final_amount)
